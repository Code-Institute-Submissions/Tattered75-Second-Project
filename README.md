# Second-Project

## MY PORTFOLIO
This is a portfolio for potential employers to review to get a quick overview of my work experience and to demonstrate my ability as a programmer. 
It will contain a standard CV as well for employers looking for a more traditional resume. This version is however more user friendly and pleasant
to look at giving a quick synopsis of my experience and abilities.

## UX
## User Stories

### First Time Visitor Goals
As a first time user I want to find it easy to navigate the site and the content should be useful and user friendly.
It has to be visually appealing so that I will want to return and have a positive opinion of the developer's skills.
It should be informative and make me want to pick up the phone and give the developer an interview.

### Returning Visitor Goals
As a returning visitor I would like to be provided access to further information as I would have had time to think and discuss the portfolio with others.
I would likely want to readily have access to contact information where my questions can be answered and have access to a formal standard CV.

### Frequent User Goals
I would want to have ready information to the developer's contact details should I wish to call her for an interview.
I would likey want access to a summary of the developer's skills should I be considering shortlisting the developer and comparing the developer's skills to
other candidates. That being the case I would expect the developer's skills to be favourably presented and readily available.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
I used a simple but bright color scheme. I felt that corporate colors like blue are not the most suitable for a web developer as developer needs to show that they can
be relied on for fresh new ideas which brighter colors convey. However I used charcoal to tone down the color scheme so as not to scare away more traditional corporations.
I felt a balance between the two would cast a wider net.
### Typography
The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported 
into the site correctly. Roboto looks professional and attractive.
## Imagery
Imagery is important. Unfortuately I had to tone it down for this type of site. I used the ideas and coding from the Code Institute lessons as felt it took the portfolio to 
the next level. I borrowed the ideas and coding of a timeline and visual persentage bars from the Code institue lessons which are visually stimulating, together with the recommended use of font awsome.

## Wireframes
I used an excel file for the wire frames as I am comfortable and familiar with it and I wanted a vivid clear structure.
I have saved it in the wireframe folder as a PDF in the Wireframe folder.

## Features
I followed the structure from Code Institute Mini Project with Bootstrap so I could have a set up guide and structure.
Then I made asthetic changes that I felt were in keeping with the type of information I was presenting
### Page one
This is the home page, designed to draw the users into the site and build confidence in the developers skills.
### Page two
This is a mini resume with a synopsis of my skills.
### Page three
This is a contact form for companies interested in using my skill for specific projects.
## Existing Features
The CV is made readily available for download on a seperate page, both in the footer and the header.
### Features Left to Implement
I have left room for further skills to be added in resume page and will addapt the page to more acurately reflect my skills.

## Technologies Used
#### Font Awesome for icons
https://fontawesome.com/
#### Bootstrap
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/buttons/#toggle-states
#### Bootsstrap Font Awesome
#### HTML & CSS coding format
#### Image
From my mobile.
#### Code
Used mostly styling from Code Institute User Centric Mini Project Lesson.

#### HTML Validator
https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea

#### CSS Validator
https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator

#### Code Institute
For the coding, most was borrowed or advised from the modules.
The structure and coding was from the portfolio project.

#### Git
Git was used via the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
#### GitHub:
GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git. 

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
*	W3C Markup Validator - Results
*	W3C CSS Validator - Results
* I tested the pages using - python3 -m http.server in Gitpod so I could see and adapt changes.

## Deployment
I started out by creating a Git pod project on Git hub.
Set up a new README.md file and used the structure from Code Institute as a guide. 
I copied the BootstrapCDN link into my style.css file and set the 3 pages, [Home (index.html), Resume (resume.html) & Contact (contact.html)]
I started with my background image to set the tone for myself to work in.
I created a Wireframe in excel, then print screened it and converted it to PDF so I could drad and drop it to the WireFrame folder I creaded in Gitpod. 
I followed Code Institute lesson format for the structure and coding. I paid close attention to the guidance from the institute and noted the various methods 
used to remove unattractive gaps.
## Credits
### Content
Much of the coding was copied from Code Institute Mini Project lessons and adapted to my prefered asthetics.
### Media
The photo used in this site were from my mobile.
## Acknowledgements
* I received inspiration for this project from my user friendly portfolio in the Code Institute Lesson "Putting it All Together Mini Project." 
I felt this was appropriate as I can adapt it in the future to reflect my actual skills and use the structure to create something similar.
* My Mentor for continuous helpful feedback.
* Tutor support at Code Institute for their continued support throughout the course.
